[**ry-cv**](https://github.com/rylanshearn/ry-cv) is a LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)** and **Cover Letter** that is basically the same as [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) only with some class adaptations to make it more suitable for academics (in particular the formatting of publications).

## <a name="usage">Usage

#### Requirements

[Installing TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/95373/63810) is highly recommended.

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``


## <a name="credit">Credit

As noted above, this is an adaptation of [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV), so credit goes to [Claud D. Park](https://github.com/posquit0) for putting most of this together.


Good luck!
